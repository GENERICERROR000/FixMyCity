6. Material-UI
  * Create Custom Theme for App

## Logic

2. Increase number of hits for specific Issue
3. Create array of Twitter users who submit same issue (after first submission of issue)

## Features

1. Live feed of Tweets
2. Maps Maps Maps

## STRETCH
  1. Server Side Routing (Branch: "ssr")
